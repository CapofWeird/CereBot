At first it's enjoyable; the sparkling blue and purple crystals scatter light throughout the region, rendering it a kaleidoscope of light. But then the cold starts to set in, and soon enough the windows of the train are covered in ice. Each breath streaks white smoke in the air, and the chill begins to sink into the bones.\n\nSome travellers threaten to stop the train, certain their destination isn't worth the risk. Others demand to plow through the ice accumulating on the tracks, taking care to keep heating systems running and exits clear.",

It's possible that the train will end up derailed. Perhaps more concerning, the wind is accompanied by a haunting whistle and faint, inaudible words.\n\nOf more immediate consequence, however, is what to do. Should the train be derailed, how should you get it back onto the track? If it tips, who will help the injured and tell the train a story to calm it down? Be careful not to be picked up by the wind yourself; it's been said a person can travel hundreds of miles on the Whistling Winds, and not all destinations are friendly.",
