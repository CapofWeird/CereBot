There's no reason for concern: if these ants are building a death ray, they are doing so far enough away that their destination isn't viewable from the train. On the other hand, they tend to become cross when they get on the train and the train's travel ruins their straight line. Of course they can't talk; don't be silly! They certainly know Morse Code, though. Don't you know that pedestrians have the right of way?",

They don't particularly care about the passengers, but the large beasts have a habit of knocking one another off their preferred perch and screeching in a way that makes it hard to enjoy the local guitar player (or sleep). How long can this racket continue? Quite a while, it turns out, as griffins, being mythical, don't require sleep.\n\nThe same cannot be said for all the denizens of the train. The longer the screeching and rocking continues, the more tempers flare. One group wants to remove the griffins, while another, more ecologically minded group refuse to disturb their natural practices. No mythical beasts will exist if we keep chasing them off trains!",

These bats were necessary for the morale of the workers and provided invaluable photographs for selling to amateur coal enthusiasts. Unfortunately, management is not fond of these creatures. Banned from the mines, the bats have a habit of swarming in dark places. Such as the cave the train is traveling through.\n\nThe bats themselves are harmless, but the flashbulbs areâ€¦ to put it mildly, very annoying. Without humans to tell them when to photograph, the bats flash anytime they are startled or interested, which is quite often. In fact, one of the most common causes of flash is a preceding flash; this can result in a flash cascade.",
